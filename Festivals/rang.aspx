        <strong><em><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">Ranga Panchami is celebrated 
        five days after the colourful festival of Holi. It is observed on the ‘Panchami’ 
        i.e. the fifth day of the Krishna Paksha, the waning phase of the moon during 
        the Hindu month of ‘Phalgun.’ Ranga Panchami is also celebrated in a colourful 
        manner and is marked by throwing ‘Gulal’ and splashing of coloured water. The 
        word ‘Rang’ means ‘color’ while ‘Panchami’ refers to the fifth day. Hence, in 
        several parts of the country, Holi is also celebrated on Ranga Panchami. It is 
        celebrated as ‘Shimgo’ or ‘Shimga’ in Maharashtra and is characterised by the 
        traditional Palkhi dance. It is observed mainly by the fishing community which 
        involves dancing and singing. In temples of Vrindavan and Mathura, the 
        celebration of Rang Panchami culminates the festivities of Holi. Devotees play 
        with colours on Rang Panchami day. Rang Panchami is more popular in Maharashtra, 
        Madhya Pradesh and some parts of North India.</span></em></strong></p>
