              <strong class="style4">According to Hindu traditions, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell where they were confined by his maternal uncle Kansa, a king of Mathura, due to prophecy of his death by the child of Devaki.
               According to tradition, a temple dedicated to Krishna was built the birthplace by his great grandson Vajranabh.
                The present site known as Krishna Janmasthan (lit. 'birthplace of Krishna') was known as Katra (lit. 'market place') Keshavdeva.
                 The archaeological excavations of the site had revealed pottery and terracotta from 6th century BC.
                  It also produced some Jain sculptures as well as a large Buddhist complex including Yasha Vihara, a monastery, belonging to Gupta period (c. 400).
                   Cunningham opined that Hindus may have occupied the former Buddhist site. 
                   The Vaishnava temple may have erected on the place as early as the first century.</strong>
