        <strong><em><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">Lathmar Holi is a local 
        celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi. It takes place days before the actual 
        Holi in the neighbouring towns of Barsana and Nandgaon near Mathura in the state 
        of Uttar Pradesh, where thousands of Hindus and tourists congregate, each year. 
        The name means &quot;that Holi in which [people] hit with sticks&quot; (laṭh is a thick 
        traditional staff). </span></em></strong>

    <p class="style3" style="font-size: small">
        <strong><em><span style="background-color: #FFCCFF">Legend has it that Lord 
        Krishna visited his beloved Radha&#39;s village on this day and playfully teased her 
        and her friends. Taking offence at this, the women of Barsana chased him away. 
        Keeping in sync with the story, the men from Nandgaon visit the town of Barsana 
        every year, only to be greeted by sticks of the women there. The ladies hurl 
        sticks at the men, who try to shield themselves as much as they can. The unlucky 
        ones are captured by the enthusiastic women who then, make the men wear female 
        clothing and dance in public. In the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani temple 
        in Barsana, which is said to be the only temple in the country that is dedicated 
        to Radha. Thousands gather to witness the Lathmar holi when women beat up men 
        with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi Songs and 
        shout Sri Radhey or Sri Krishna. The Holi songs of Braj mandal are sung in pure 
        Braj Bhasha</span></em></strong></p>
