              Sanatan Goswami ji used to go to Madhukari, a Choubey house in Mathura. The woman of the Choubey was parambhakta and Madan Mohan Ji's worshipper, madan Mohan Bhagwan Vaira in her home. In fact, Sanatan Ji used to go to Choubey's house on the pretext of Madhukari every day for the darshan of Madan Mohan Ji. Madan Mohan Ji, who stayed at Guar, used to eat in a container with the boy of Choubey Ji. It was a great surprise to the Sanatan Ji, and madan Mohan is a big picture. One day, he urged Madan Mohan Ji to ask for a false grain in Madhukari. The woman of Choubey also accepted, just what was then, she now got a chew of grain with the tongue of the Makhan thief, and she began to take the same grain every day.

              On the second day, Sanatan Baba Ji saw a big businessman coming close to him, he bowed down to the Sanatan Baba and said in karun voice: Mahatma Ji, my ship is stuck in the middle of yamuna, bless him to leave. Sanatan Baba said, "The brother does not know anything, say that he is sitting in this hut. The businessman prayed to Lord Madan Mohan Ji, who was in the hut, and the ship went out at the same time. At the same time, the businessman, with a great generosity, became the same magnificent temple of Lord Madan Mohan Ji and put up a lot of servants, chefs and Notax to serve God.
