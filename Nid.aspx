      It is said that all the creepers of the fund are goers. Who is standing in the arms of each other when radha Rani Ji, in the fund at midnight, does ras Lila with Bihari Ji. Therefore, the creeper of the country becomes the goers. And then ras Lila begins. No one can see this Ras Lila. Throughout the day, thousands of monkeys, birds, animals live in the fund, as soon as the evening takes place. All the creatures go from their own, and even a bird does not stop there. Even all the creatures inside the ground go inside the ground. No one can see Radha Krishna's Ras Lila because Ras Lila is not the lila of this worldly world, ras is the ultimate divinity of the supernatural world. No ordinary human being or organism can see with his eyes. The big saint, who is a great saint, has heard the sound of Radharani Ji and Nupur of the goers.
      When Radha Rani Ji is very tired, Bihari Ji presses his stage Lotus. And, at night, they are sleeping in the fund, even today, there is a bedroom in the fund where even today the priest ji is a water vessel, pan, full and prasad. And when the morning opens, the water is yellow, the pan is chewed and the flowers are scattered.
