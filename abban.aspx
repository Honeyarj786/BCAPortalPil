    Sridham Vrindavan. It is such a sacred land. The land on which all the papas are destroyed.
     Shri Bank Bihari Ji Temple was constructed in 1629 with the effort of Swami Shri Haridas Ji's Vanjo.          
              </br>
    </br>
    Shri Haridas Was Swami Ji Vaishnava. Pleased with his mass kirtan, Mr. Bank Bihari appeared from the fund. Swami Shri Haridas Ji was born in a village called Rajpur near Vrindavan. His Ardhyadev was Shri Bank Bihari Ji. His father's name was Gangadhar and Mata's name was Smt. Chitdevi. Haridas Ji was the disciple of Swami Ashudhir Devji. By looking at them, Ashudhir Devji knew that this was the embodiment of Sakhi Lalita Ji. And on the day of Radhakrishnan, Bhakti Pradani is here for the Darson Lila of Shri Radha Ji's Mangal Mahotsav. They lived in the world since childhood.

    In adolescence, he took the couple's mantra diksha from Ashudhir Ji and began to meditate in a secluded place at Nikunj near Yamuna. When he was 25 years old, he received a disused masquerade from his Guruji and began to think of the continual lilao of Nikunj Bihari Ji away from the world. In Nikunj Forest itself, Swami Haridas Ji had a dream to remove the statue of Bihari Ji. Then, according to his command, Mr. Viagraha, with a manohar Shyamvan image, went out of the lap of the stream. The same beautiful statue went ahead and was known as Shri Bank Bihari Ji. On the date of the statue of Shri Bank Bihari Ji, we consider bihar-Panchami with great gaiety.

    Shri Banke had been serving by Swami Ji for a long time in the Bihari fund. Then, when the construction work of the temple was completed, they were brought and established. Shri Krishna Yetiji used to serve Shri Bihari Ji. Then, In 1675, Yetiji appointed Hargulal Seth Ji to take over the service system of Shri Bihari Ji. In the period of time, swami Haridas Ji's worship system changed to a new community, independent of the Nimwark community and became a Sakhi community.
