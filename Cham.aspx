After liberating the dragon, Shri Krishna had made a vision of Mother Chamunda

Out of 51 shaktichairs, the temple of mother Chamunda, which is described as the principal power bench, remains in front of the mother Gayatri Taponland on mathura-Vrindavan Marg. This place is described as that place. The mother Bhagwati jagdamba's hair fell. The description of this temple is also heard in Srimebhagwat. It is said that in this temple of the Golden Age, Shri Krishna had appeared in mother Chamunda after giving freedom to the dragon. The temple is also described as the ascetic of the Shantya Rishi. It is said that Guru Gorakhnath had attained perfection in this temple. The temple is described as the total goddess of the enthroned mother Chamunda Nand Baba. It is said that Nand Baba, along with the Gwal-hair, had planted the same chamunda mother after shri Krishna's mundon at Saraswati Kund. In navratri days, devotees come from far flung places to visit. On every Sunday and on the ashtami and Navami day of Navratri, there is a gathering of devotees here. Akshay Navami and Deobit Ekadashi Festival also have a large amount of devotees here. Because the importance of all the temples studying in the parikrama of Mathura and the three forests that take off these days is stated. The main thing is that there is no statue of mother Chamunda in this temple, but it itself has been produced..</strong>
